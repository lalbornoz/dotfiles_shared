" This is a special kind of option, because when it's set or reset, other
" options are also changed as a side effect.  CAREFUL: Setting or resetting
" this option can have a lot of unexpected effects: Mappings are interpreted
" in another way, undo behaves differently, etc.  If you set this option in
" your vimrc file, you should probably put it at the very start.
" [ ... ]
" When a |vimrc| or |gvimrc| file is found while Vim is starting up, this option
" is switched off, and all options that have not been modified will be set to
" the Vim defaults.  Effectively, this means that when a |vimrc| or |gvimrc|
" file exists, Vim will use the Vim defaults, otherwise it will use the Vi
" defaults.  (Note: This doesn't happen for the system-wide vimrc or gvimrc
" file, nor for a file given with the |-u| argument).
